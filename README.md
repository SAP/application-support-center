## Features

- Central application management: ASC acts as a central management portal for all of your applications. Store a list of application owners, developers, source code links, and application details in one place.
- In-app Help: ASC provides a Mobile SDK, UI5 SDK, Web SDK, Web Portal and API's sharing help, release notes, and details about each application for your end-users. This provides the opportunity for self-service before they contact support.
- Developers: ASC is simple to integrate in applications and reduces the need to recompile and deploy when help, release notes, announcements or support contacts change. Our drop-in SDK's provide content syncing and are available for Android, iOS, UI5 and HTML based applications with just a few lines of code.
- Application Owners: ASC provides a central location to store application details and the ability to update in-app support content without needing to get developers involved.
- Consistency: ASC provides a consistent look and feel across all your apps and platforms giving your users a familiar experience when it's needed.
